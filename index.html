   <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Trufseeka</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 40px;">This product is currently under construction and very much still a baby. I'm not fully sure what to build here. I know that I want to build an app for the truth-seeker. A central hub for all his truth-seeking related activities. It should include a writing editor, a first-principles truth-checker program that builds from physics knowledge and can verify any input from the ground up, an experiment designer, a "grand theory of everything" section where you can play with ideas and move around different texts or files like in a mind-map with the probably impossible to achieve goal of coming to an ultimate conclusion of about everything, and maybe also a link/text scraper to have all your reading stored in the Trufseeka app so that you can read all your articles and blog posts and papers and whatever in a beautiful reading experience that is well organized.</p>
